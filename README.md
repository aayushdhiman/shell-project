# Shell

Built a shell in C as a project for a systems class. Based off of some starter code, but is almost entirely created by me and a partner in class. 

Completed 10/29/2022.

The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the following targets:

- `make all` - compile everything
- `make tokenize` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make shell` - compile the shell
- `make shell-tests` - run a few tests against the shell
- `make test` - compile and run all the tests
- `make clean` - perform a minimal clean-up of the source tree
